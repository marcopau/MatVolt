# Overview

The MatVolt library provides a set of different algorithms for power flow and state estimation. 
At the moment, available algorithms are: 

## Power Flow

- [Least Squares](../Theory/LSnotes) (LS) method
    - [Node voltage]()-based

## State Estimation

- Conventional [Weighted Least Squares](../Theory/WLSnotes) (WLS), with virtual measurements
    - [Rectangular node voltage]() WLS 
    - [Rectangular branch current]() WLS 

-------------------------------

# Roadmap/coming soon

We are actively working on extending this library by introducing new algorithms and features. For a view on what we are going to release, have a look [here](/To_do.md).

# Known issues and limitations

In the available algorithms, some specific features may be still missing. [Here](/Known_issues.md) you can find a list of the known limitations currently present in the published code.
