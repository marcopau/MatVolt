# MatVolt
MatVolt is an open source library of power system power flow and state estimation algorithms implemented in Matlab.

It provides state estimation solvers together with additional functions for implementing, testing and validating power system state estimation algorithms.
The available material may be useful for:

- off-line analysis of the performance of specific state estimation solutions in a given power system scenario;
- on-line running of state estimation modules within dedicated software-in-the-loop simulations;
- didactic presentation of the state estimation topic, with a view of the theory and the related implementation of the algorithms.

## Getting started

- An overview of all the state estimation algorithms currently available in MatVolt can be found in the [Overview](/Docs/Overview/SE_library.md) section.
- A review of the concepts behind power system state estimation is available in the [Theory](/Docs/Theory/Index.md) section.
- For a closer look to the code, its structure and description, go the [Source code](/Docs/Code/Code_structure.md) section.
- For a step-by-step guide on running the Matlab code and using the state estimation algorithms, go to our [Tutorials](/Docs/Tutorials/Summary.md) section.
